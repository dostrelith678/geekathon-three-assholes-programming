## Description

DoppelChat is an innovative platform designed for influencers to connect with their audience in a unique way. The application allows influencers to create personalized AI clones, known as "Doppels," which users can interact with through chat. One distinctive feature is the ability for Doppels to generate realistic selfies on user request, enhancing the immersive experience for both influencers and their followers.

## Problem Statement

In the competitive landscape of social media, followers often seek more authentic and personalized connections with their favorite influencers. Traditional forms of interaction may fall short in providing the depth of engagement users desire. Additionally, influencers face challenges in managing individual responses to a large audience.

## Solution
DoppelChat addresses these challenges by enabling influencers to create AI clones that not only emulate their personalities but also have the capability to generate realistic selfies. This feature adds a personal touch to the interaction, making it more visually engaging for users. Users can select from a list of Doppels, each with the ability to create unique and personalized selfies on request.

### Key Features

## Getting Started

There are two components of this project, the frontend NextJS app located in the root directory and the backend NodeJS app located in `/backend`. To start the application, create a `/backend/.env` file based on the `/backend/.env.example` file. Then, start the backend server with:

`npm run start` (from the `/backend` directory)

To start the frontend app, run:
`npm run dev` (from root directory)

The backend API runs on port 3008 and the frontend on 3000 by default.

You can navigate to page `localhost:3000/signup` to start.
